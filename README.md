    <li>As they get older, they get hungrier and less fit</li>
    <li>You can walk your pet to increase it's fitness.</li>
    <li>You can feed your pet to decrease it's hunger.</li>
    <li>You can talk to your pet to see if it needs feeding or walking</li>
    <li>If your pet gets too hungry or unfit, it will DIE</li>
    <li>If your pet gets to 30 days old it will DIE</li>
